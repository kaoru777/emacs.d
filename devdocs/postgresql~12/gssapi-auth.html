<h1>20.6. GSSAPI Authentication</h1>    <p>GSSAPI is an industry-standard protocol for secure authentication defined in RFC 2743. PostgreSQL supports GSSAPI for use as either an encrypted, authenticated layer, or for authentication only. GSSAPI provides automatic authentication (single sign-on) for systems that support it. The authentication itself is secure. If GSSAPI encryption (see <code class="literal">hostgssenc</code>) or SSL encryption are used, the data sent along the database connection will be encrypted; otherwise, it will not.</p> <p>GSSAPI support has to be enabled when PostgreSQL is built; see <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/installation.html" title="Chapter 16. Installation from Source Code">Chapter 16</a> for more information.</p> <p>When GSSAPI uses Kerberos, it uses a standard principal in the format <code class="literal">servicename/hostname@realm</code>. The PostgreSQL server will accept any principal that is included in the keytab used by the server, but care needs to be taken to specify the correct principal details when making the connection from the client using the <code class="literal">krbsrvname</code> connection parameter. (See also <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS" title="33.1.2. Parameter Key Words">Section 33.1.2</a>.) The installation default can be changed from the default <code class="literal">postgres</code> at build time using <code class="literal">./configure --with-krb-srvnam=</code><code>whatever</code>. In most environments, this parameter never needs to be changed. Some Kerberos implementations might require a different service name, such as Microsoft Active Directory which requires the service name to be in upper case (<code class="literal">POSTGRES</code>).</p> <p><code>hostname</code> is the fully qualified host name of the server machine. The service principal's realm is the preferred realm of the server machine.</p> <p>Client principals can be mapped to different PostgreSQL database user names with <code class="filename">pg_ident.conf</code>. For example, <code class="literal">pgusername@realm</code> could be mapped to just <code class="literal">pgusername</code>. Alternatively, you can use the full <code class="literal">username@realm</code> principal as the role name in PostgreSQL without any mapping.</p> <p>PostgreSQL also supports a parameter to strip the realm from the principal. This method is supported for backwards compatibility and is strongly discouraged as it is then impossible to distinguish different users with the same user name but coming from different realms. To enable this, set <code class="literal">include_realm</code> to 0. For simple single-realm installations, doing that combined with setting the <code class="literal">krb_realm</code> parameter (which checks that the principal's realm matches exactly what is in the <code class="literal">krb_realm</code> parameter) is still secure; but this is a less capable approach compared to specifying an explicit mapping in <code class="filename">pg_ident.conf</code>.</p> <p>Make sure that your server keytab file is readable (and preferably only readable, not writable) by the PostgreSQL server account. (See also <a class="xref" href="postgres-user" title="18.1. The PostgreSQL User Account">Section 18.1</a>.) The location of the key file is specified by the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-connection#GUC-KRB-SERVER-KEYFILE">krb_server_keyfile</a> configuration parameter. The default is <code class="filename">/usr/local/pgsql/etc/krb5.keytab</code> (or whatever directory was specified as <code class="varname">sysconfdir</code> at build time). For security reasons, it is recommended to use a separate keytab just for the PostgreSQL server rather than opening up permissions on the system keytab file.</p> <p>The keytab file is generated by the Kerberos software; see the Kerberos documentation for details. The following example is for MIT-compatible Kerberos 5 implementations:</p> <pre>
kadmin% <strong class="userinput">ank -randkey postgres/server.my.domain.org</strong>
kadmin% <strong class="userinput">ktadd -k krb5.keytab postgres/server.my.domain.org</strong>
</pre> <p>When connecting to the database make sure you have a ticket for a principal matching the requested database user name. For example, for database user name <code class="literal">fred</code>, principal <code class="literal">fred@EXAMPLE.COM</code> would be able to connect. To also allow principal <code class="literal">fred/users.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM</code>, use a user name map, as described in <a class="xref" href="auth-username-maps" title="20.2. User Name Maps">Section 20.2</a>.</p> <p>The following configuration options are supported for GSSAPI:</p> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">include_realm</code></dt> <dd> <p>If set to 0, the realm name from the authenticated user principal is stripped off before being passed through the user name mapping (<a class="xref" href="auth-username-maps" title="20.2. User Name Maps">Section 20.2</a>). This is discouraged and is primarily available for backwards compatibility, as it is not secure in multi-realm environments unless <code class="literal">krb_realm</code> is also used. It is recommended to leave <code class="literal">include_realm</code> set to the default (1) and to provide an explicit mapping in <code class="filename">pg_ident.conf</code> to convert principal names to PostgreSQL user names.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">map</code></dt> <dd> <p>Allows for mapping between system and database user names. See <a class="xref" href="auth-username-maps" title="20.2. User Name Maps">Section 20.2</a> for details. For a GSSAPI/Kerberos principal, such as <code class="literal">username@EXAMPLE.COM</code> (or, less commonly, <code class="literal">username/hostbased@EXAMPLE.COM</code>), the user name used for mapping is <code class="literal">username@EXAMPLE.COM</code> (or <code class="literal">username/hostbased@EXAMPLE.COM</code>, respectively), unless <code class="literal">include_realm</code> has been set to 0, in which case <code class="literal">username</code> (or <code class="literal">username/hostbased</code>) is what is seen as the system user name when mapping.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">krb_realm</code></dt> <dd> <p>Sets the realm to match user principal names against. If this parameter is set, only users of that realm will be accepted. If it is not set, users of any realm can connect, subject to whatever user name mapping is done.</p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <div class="navfooter">  <table summary="Navigation footer"> <tr> <td width="40%" align="left">
