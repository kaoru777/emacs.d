Servers will be either a master or a standby server. Masters can send data, while standbys are always receivers of replicated data. When cascading replication (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby#CASCADING-REPLICATION" title="26.2.7. Cascading Replication">Section 26.2.7</a>) is used, standby servers can also be senders, as well as receivers.

Sending Servers</h2>    <p>These parameters can be set on any server that is to send replication data to one or more standby servers. The master is always a sending server, so these parameters must always be set on the master.

<code class="varname">max_wal_senders</code> (<code class="type">integer</code>) </dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients (i.e., the maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes). The default is 10. The value 0 means replication is disabled. WAL sender processes count towards the total number of connections, so this parameter's value must be less than <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-connection#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS">max_connections</a> minus <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-connection#GUC-SUPERUSER-RESERVED-CONNECTIONS">superuser_reserved_connections</a>. Abrupt streaming client disconnection might leave an orphaned connection slot behind until a timeout is reached, so this parameter should be set slightly higher than the maximum number of expected clients so disconnected clients can immediately reconnect. This parameter can only be set at server start. Also, <code class="varname">wal_level</code> must be set to <code class="literal">replica</code> or higher to allow connections from standby servers.</p> </dd> <dt id="GUC-MAX-REPLICATION-SLOTS">

The default is 10. This parameter can only be set at server start. Setting it to a lower value than the number of currently existing replication slots will prevent the server from starting.

<code class="varname">wal_keep_segments</code> (<code class="type">integer</code>) </dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the minimum number of past log file segments kept in the <code class="filename">pg_wal</code> directory, in case a standby server needs to fetch them for streaming replication. Each segment is normally 16 megabytes. If a standby server connected to the sending server falls behind by more than <code class="varname">wal_keep_segments</code> segments, the sending server might remove a WAL segment still needed by the standby, in which case the replication connection will be terminated. Downstream connections will also eventually fail as a result. (However, the standby server can recover by fetching the segment from archive, if WAL archiving is in use.)</p> <p>This sets only the minimum number of segments retained in <code class="filename">pg_wal</code>; the system might need to retain more segments for WAL archival or to recover from a checkpoint. If <code class="varname">wal_keep_segments</code> is zero (the default), the system doesn't keep any extra segments for standby purposes, so the number of old WAL segments available to standby servers is a function of the location of the previous checkpoint and status of WAL archiving.

There will be one or more active synchronous standbys; transactions waiting for commit will be allowed to proceed after these standby servers confirm receipt of their data. The synchronous standbys will be those whose names appear in this list, and that are both currently connected and streaming data in real-time (as shown by a state of <code class="literal">streaming</code> in the <a class="link" href="monitoring-stats#PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW" title="Table 28.5. pg_stat_replication View"><code class="literal">pg_stat_replication</code></a> view). Specifying more than one synchronous standby can allow for very high availability and protection against data loss.</p> <p>The name of a standby server for this purpose is the <code class="varname">application_name</code> setting of the standby, as set in the standby's connection information. In case of a physical replication standby, this should be set in the <code class="varname">primary_conninfo</code> setting in <code class="filename">recovery.conf</code>; the default is <code class="literal">walreceiver</code>. For logical replication, this can be set in the connection information of the subscription, and it defaults to the subscription name. For other replication stream consumers, consult their documentation.</p> <p>This parameter specifies a list of standby servers using either of the following syntaxes:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
[FIRST] num_sync ( standby_name [, ...] )
ANY num_sync ( standby_name [, ...] )
standby_name [, ...]
</pre> <p>where <code>num_sync</code> is the number of synchronous standbys that transactions need to wait for replies from, and <code>standby_name</code> is the name of a standby server. <code class="literal">FIRST</code> and <code class="literal">ANY</code> specify the method to choose synchronous standbys from the listed servers.</p> <p>The keyword <code class="literal">FIRST</code>, coupled with <code>num_sync</code>, specifies a priority-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to <code>num_sync</code> synchronous standbys chosen based on their priorities. For example, a setting of <code class="literal">FIRST 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)</code> will cause each commit to wait for replies from three higher-priority standbys chosen from standby servers <code class="literal">s1</code>, <code class="literal">s2</code>, <code class="literal">s3</code> and <code class="literal">s4</code>. The standbys whose names appear earlier in the list are given higher priority and will be considered as synchronous. Other standby servers appearing later in this list represent potential synchronous standbys. If any of the current synchronous standbys disconnects for whatever reason, it will be replaced immediately with the next-highest-priority standby. The keyword <code class="literal">FIRST</code> is optional.</p> <p>The keyword <code class="literal">ANY</code>, coupled with <code>num_sync</code>, specifies a quorum-based synchronous replication and makes transaction commits wait until their WAL records are replicated to <span class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> <code>num_sync</code> listed standbys. For example, a setting of <code class="literal">ANY 3 (s1, s2, s3, s4)</code> will cause each commit to proceed as soon as at least any three standbys of <code class="literal">s1</code>, <code class="literal">s2</code>, <code class="literal">s3</code> and <code class="literal">s4</code> reply.</p> <p><code class="literal">FIRST</code> and <code class="literal">ANY</code> are case-insensitive. If these keywords are used as the name of a standby server, its <code>standby_name</code> must be double-quoted.</p> <p>The third syntax was used before PostgreSQL version 9.6 and is still supported. It's the same as the first syntax with <code class="literal">FIRST</code> and <code>num_sync</code> equal to 1. For example, <code class="literal">FIRST 1 (s1, s2)</code> and <code class="literal">s1, s2</code> have the same meaning: either <code class="literal">s1</code> or <code class="literal">s2</code> is chosen as a synchronous standby.</p> <p>The special entry <code class="literal">*</code> matches any standby name.</p> <p>There is no mechanism to enforce uniqueness of standby names. In case of duplicates one of the matching standbys will be considered as higher priority, though exactly which one is indeterminate.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>Each <code>standby_name</code> should have the form of a valid SQL identifier, unless it is <code class="literal">*</code>.

This is the default configuration. Even when synchronous replication is enabled, individual transactions can be configured not to wait for replication by setting the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT">synchronous_commit</a> parameter to <code class="literal">local</code> or <code class="literal">off</code>.</p> <p>This parameter can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file or on the server command line.</p> </dd> <dt id="GUC-VACUUM-DEFER-CLEANUP-AGE">

You may wish to set this to a non-zero value on a primary server that is supporting hot standby servers, as described in <a class="xref" href="hot-standby" title="26.5. Hot Standby">Section 26.5</a>. This allows more time for queries on the standby to complete without incurring conflicts due to early cleanup of rows.
