VACUUM [ ( option [, ...] ) ] [ table_and_columns [, ...] ]
VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] [ ANALYZE ] [ table_and_columns [, ...] ]

where option can be one of:

    FULL

and table_and_columns is:

    table_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ]
</pre>  <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.183.5"> <h2>Description</h2> <p><code class="command">VACUUM</code> reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples. In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from their table; they remain present until a <code class="command">VACUUM</code> is done. Therefore it's necessary to do <code class="command">VACUUM</code> periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables.</p> <p>Without a <code>table_and_columns</code> list, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> processes every table and materialized view in the current database that the current user has permission to vacuum. With a list, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> processes only those table(s).</p> <p><code class="command">VACUUM ANALYZE</code> performs a <code class="command">VACUUM</code> and then an <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> for each selected table. This is a handy combination form for routine maintenance scripts. See <a class="xref" href="sql-analyze" title="ANALYZE">ANALYZE</a> for more details about its processing.</p> <p>Plain <code class="command">VACUUM</code> (without <code class="literal">FULL</code>) simply reclaims space and makes it available for re-use. This form of the command can operate in parallel with normal reading and writing of the table, as an exclusive lock is not obtained. However, extra space is not returned to the operating system (in most cases); it's just kept available for re-use within the same table. <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> rewrites the entire contents of the table into a new disk file with no extra space, allowing unused space to be returned to the operating system. This form is much slower and requires an exclusive lock on each table while it is being processed.</p> <p>When the option list is surrounded by parentheses, the options can be written in any order. Without parentheses, options must be specified in exactly the order shown above. The parenthesized syntax was added in PostgreSQL 9.0; the unparenthesized syntax is deprecated.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.183.6"> <h2>Parameters</h2> <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt><code class="literal">FULL</code></dt> <dd> <p>Selects <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">full</span>”</span> vacuum, which can reclaim more space, but takes much longer and exclusively locks the table. This method also requires extra disk space, since it writes a new copy of the table and doesn't release the old copy until the operation is complete. Usually this should only be used when a significant amount of space needs to be reclaimed from within the table.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">FREEZE</code></dt> <dd> <p>Selects aggressive <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">freezing</span>”</span> of tuples. Specifying <code class="literal">FREEZE</code> is equivalent to performing <code class="command">VACUUM</code> with the <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client#GUC-VACUUM-FREEZE-MIN-AGE">vacuum_freeze_min_age</a> and <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-client#GUC-VACUUM-FREEZE-TABLE-AGE">vacuum_freeze_table_age</a> parameters set to zero. Aggressive freezing is always performed when the table is rewritten, so this option is redundant when <code class="literal">FULL</code> is specified.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">VERBOSE</code></dt> <dd> <p>Prints a detailed vacuum activity report for each table.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">ANALYZE</code></dt> <dd> <p>Updates statistics used by the planner to determine the most efficient way to execute a query.</p> </dd> <dt><code class="literal">DISABLE_PAGE_SKIPPING</code></dt> <dd> <p>Normally, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> will skip pages based on the <a class="link" href="routine-vacuuming#VACUUM-FOR-VISIBILITY-MAP" title="24.1.4. Updating The Visibility Map">visibility map</a>. Pages where all tuples are known to be frozen can always be skipped, and those where all tuples are known to be visible to all transactions may be skipped except when performing an aggressive vacuum. Furthermore, except when performing an aggressive vacuum, some pages may be skipped in order to avoid waiting for other sessions to finish using them. This option disables all page-skipping behavior, and is intended to be used only when the contents of the visibility map are suspect, which should happen only if there is a hardware or software issue causing database corruption.</p> </dd> <dt><code>table_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a specific table or materialized view to vacuum. If the specified table is a partitioned table, all of its leaf partitions are vacuumed.</p> </dd> <dt><code>column_name</code></dt> <dd> <p>The name of a specific column to analyze. Defaults to all columns. If a column list is specified, <code class="literal">ANALYZE</code> must also be specified.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.183.7"> <h2>Outputs</h2> <p>When <code class="literal">VERBOSE</code> is specified, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> emits progress messages to indicate which table is currently being processed. Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.</p> </div> <div class="refsect1" id="id-1.9.3.183.8"> <h2>Notes</h2> <p>To vacuum a table, one must ordinarily be the table's owner or a superuser. However, database owners are allowed to vacuum all tables in their databases, except shared catalogs. (The restriction for shared catalogs means that a true database-wide <code class="command">VACUUM</code> can only be performed by a superuser.) <code class="command">VACUUM</code> will skip over any tables that the calling user does not have permission to vacuum.</p> <p><code class="command">VACUUM</code> cannot be executed inside a transaction block.</p> <p>For tables with GIN indexes, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> (in any form) also completes any pending index insertions, by moving pending index entries to the appropriate places in the main GIN index structure. See <a class="xref" href="gin-implementation#GIN-FAST-UPDATE" title="66.4.1. GIN Fast Update Technique">Section 66.4.1</a> for details.</p> <p>We recommend that active production databases be vacuumed frequently (at least nightly), in order to remove dead rows. After adding or deleting a large number of rows, it might be a good idea to issue a <code class="command">VACUUM ANALYZE</code> command for the affected table. This will update the system catalogs with the results of all recent changes, and allow the PostgreSQL query planner to make better choices in planning queries.</p> <p>The <code class="option">FULL</code> option is not recommended for routine use, but might be useful in special cases. An example is when you have deleted or updated most of the rows in a table and would like the table to physically shrink to occupy less disk space and allow faster table scans. <code class="command">VACUUM FULL</code> will usually shrink the table more than a plain <code class="command">VACUUM</code> would.</p> <p><code class="command">VACUUM</code> causes a substantial increase in I/O traffic, which might cause poor performance for other active sessions. Therefore, it is sometimes advisable to use the cost-based vacuum delay feature. See <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-resource#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-VACUUM-COST" title="19.4.4. Cost-based Vacuum Delay">Section 19.4.4</a> for details.</p> <p>PostgreSQL includes an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">autovacuum</span>”</span> facility which can automate routine vacuum maintenance.
