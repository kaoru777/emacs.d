<h1>27.1. Archive Recovery Settings</h1>    <div class="variablelist"> <dl class="variablelist"> <dt id="RESTORE-COMMAND">
<code class="varname">restore_command</code> (<code class="type">string</code>) </dt> <dd> <p>The local shell command to execute to retrieve an archived segment of the WAL file series. This parameter is required for archive recovery, but optional for streaming replication. Any <code class="literal">%f</code> in the string is replaced by the name of the file to retrieve from the archive, and any <code class="literal">%p</code> is replaced by the copy destination path name on the server. (The path name is relative to the current working directory, i.e., the cluster's data directory.) Any <code class="literal">%r</code> is replaced by the name of the file containing the last valid restart point. That is the earliest file that must be kept to allow a restore to be restartable, so this information can be used to truncate the archive to just the minimum required to support restarting from the current restore. <code class="literal">%r</code> is typically only used by warm-standby configurations (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby" title="26.2. Log-Shipping Standby Servers">Section 26.2</a>). Write <code class="literal">%%</code> to embed an actual <code class="literal">%</code> character.</p> <p>It is important for the command to return a zero exit status only if it succeeds. The command <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be asked for file names that are not present in the archive; it must return nonzero when so asked. Examples:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
restore_command = 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f "%p"'
restore_command = 'copy "C:\\server\\archivedir\\%f" "%p"'  # Windows
</pre> <p>An exception is that if the command was terminated by a signal (other than <span class="systemitem">SIGTERM</span>, which is used as part of a database server shutdown) or an error by the shell (such as command not found), then recovery will abort and the server will not start up.</p> </dd> <dt id="ARCHIVE-CLEANUP-COMMAND">
<code class="varname">archive_cleanup_command</code> (<code class="type">string</code>) </dt> <dd> <p>This optional parameter specifies a shell command that will be executed at every restartpoint. The purpose of <code class="varname">archive_cleanup_command</code> is to provide a mechanism for cleaning up old archived WAL files that are no longer needed by the standby server. Any <code class="literal">%r</code> is replaced by the name of the file containing the last valid restart point. That is the earliest file that must be <span class="emphasis"><em>kept</em></span> to allow a restore to be restartable, and so all files earlier than <code class="literal">%r</code> may be safely removed. This information can be used to truncate the archive to just the minimum required to support restart from the current restore. The <a class="xref" href="pgarchivecleanup" title="pg_archivecleanup">pg_archivecleanup</a> module is often used in <code class="varname">archive_cleanup_command</code> for single-standby configurations, for example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">archive_cleanup_command = 'pg_archivecleanup /mnt/server/archivedir %r'</pre> <p>Note however that if multiple standby servers are restoring from the same archive directory, you will need to ensure that you do not delete WAL files until they are no longer needed by any of the servers. <code class="varname">archive_cleanup_command</code> would typically be used in a warm-standby configuration (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby" title="26.2. Log-Shipping Standby Servers">Section 26.2</a>). Write <code class="literal">%%</code> to embed an actual <code class="literal">%</code> character in the command.</p> <p>If the command returns a nonzero exit status then a warning log message will be written. An exception is that if the command was terminated by a signal or an error by the shell (such as command not found), a fatal error will be raised.</p> </dd> <dt id="RECOVERY-END-COMMAND">
<code class="varname">recovery_end_command</code> (<code class="type">string</code>) </dt> <dd> <p>This parameter specifies a shell command that will be executed once only at the end of recovery. This parameter is optional. The purpose of the <code class="varname">recovery_end_command</code> is to provide a mechanism for cleanup following replication or recovery. Any <code class="literal">%r</code> is replaced by the name of the file containing the last valid restart point, like in <a class="xref" href="archive-recovery-settings#ARCHIVE-CLEANUP-COMMAND">archive_cleanup_command</a>.</p> <p>If the command returns a nonzero exit status then a warning log message will be written and the database will proceed to start up anyway. An exception is that if the command was terminated by a signal or an error by the shell (such as command not found), the database will not proceed with startup.</p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <div class="navfooter">  <table summary="Navigation footer"> <tr> <td width="40%" align="left">
