<h1>31.9. Security</h1>    <p>A user able to modify the schema of subscriber-side tables can execute arbitrary code as the role which owns any subscription which modifies those tables. Limit ownership and <code class="literal">TRIGGER</code> privilege on such tables to trusted roles. Moreover, if untrusted users can create tables, use only publications that list tables explicitly. That is to say, create a subscription <code class="literal">FOR ALL TABLES</code> or <code class="literal">FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA</code> only when superusers trust every user permitted to create a non-temp table on the publisher or the subscriber.</p> <p>The role used for the replication connection must have the <code class="literal">REPLICATION</code> attribute (or be a superuser). If the role lacks <code class="literal">SUPERUSER</code> and <code class="literal">BYPASSRLS</code>, publisher row security policies can execute. If the role does not trust all table owners, include <code class="literal">options=-crow_security=off</code> in the connection string; if a table owner then adds a row security policy, that setting will cause replication to halt rather than execute the policy. Access for the role must be configured in <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code> and it must have the <code class="literal">LOGIN</code> attribute.</p> <p>In order to be able to copy the initial table data, the role used for the replication connection must have the <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege on a published table (or be a superuser).</p> <p>To create a publication, the user must have the <code class="literal">CREATE</code> privilege in the database.</p> <p>To add tables to a publication, the user must have ownership rights on the table. To add all tables in schema to a publication, the user must be a superuser. To create a publication that publishes all tables or all tables in schema automatically, the user must be a superuser.</p> <p>To create a subscription, the user must be a superuser.</p> <p>The subscription apply process will run in the local database with the privileges of the subscription owner.</p> <p>On the publisher, privileges are only checked once at the start of a replication connection and are not re-checked as each change record is read.</p> <p>On the subscriber, the subscription owner's privileges are re-checked for each transaction when applied. If a worker is in the process of applying a transaction when the ownership of the subscription is changed by a concurrent transaction, the application of the current transaction will continue under the old owner's privileges.</p><div class="_attribution">
