<h1>31.10. Configuration Settings</h1>    <p>Logical replication requires several configuration options to be set.</p> <p>On the publisher side, <code class="varname">wal_level</code> must be set to <code class="literal">logical</code>, and <code class="varname">max_replication_slots</code> must be set to at least the number of subscriptions expected to connect, plus some reserve for table synchronization. And <code class="varname">max_wal_senders</code> should be set to at least the same as <code class="varname">max_replication_slots</code> plus the number of physical replicas that are connected at the same time.</p> <p><code class="varname">max_replication_slots</code> must also be set on the subscriber. It should be set to at least the number of subscriptions that will be added to the subscriber, plus some reserve for table synchronization. <code class="varname">max_logical_replication_workers</code> must be set to at least the number of subscriptions, again plus some reserve for the table synchronization. Additionally the <code class="varname">max_worker_processes</code> may need to be adjusted to accommodate for replication workers, at least (<code class="varname">max_logical_replication_workers</code> + <code class="literal">1</code>). Note that some extensions and parallel queries also take worker slots from <code class="varname">max_worker_processes</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
