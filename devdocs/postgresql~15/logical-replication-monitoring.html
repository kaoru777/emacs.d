<h1>31.8. Monitoring</h1>    <p>Because logical replication is based on a similar architecture as <a class="link" href="warm-standby#STREAMING-REPLICATION" title="27.2.5. Streaming Replication">physical streaming replication</a>, the monitoring on a publication node is similar to monitoring of a physical replication primary (see <a class="xref" href="warm-standby#STREAMING-REPLICATION-MONITORING" title="27.2.5.2. Monitoring">Section 27.2.5.2</a>).</p> <p>The monitoring information about subscription is visible in <a class="link" href="monitoring-stats#MONITORING-PG-STAT-SUBSCRIPTION" title="28.2.8. pg_stat_subscription"><code class="structname">pg_stat_subscription</code></a>. This view contains one row for every subscription worker. A subscription can have zero or more active subscription workers depending on its state.</p> <p>Normally, there is a single apply process running for an enabled subscription. A disabled subscription or a crashed subscription will have zero rows in this view. If the initial data synchronization of any table is in progress, there will be additional workers for the tables being synchronized.</p><div class="_attribution">
