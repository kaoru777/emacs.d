public @interface Documented</pre> <p>If the annotation <code>@Documented</code> is present on the declaration of an annotation type <i>A</i>, then any <code>@A</code> annotation on an element is considered part of the element's public contract. In more detail, when an annotation type <i>A</i> is annotated with <code>Documented</code>, the presence and value of annotations of type <i>A</i> are a part of the public contract of the elements <i>A</i> annotates. Conversely, if an annotation type <i>B</i> is <em>not</em> annotated with <code>Documented</code>, the presence and value of <i>B</i> annotations are <em>not</em> part of the public contract of the elements <i>B</i> annotates. Concretely, if an annotation type is annotated with <code>
 Documented</code>, by default a tool like javadoc will display annotations of that type in its output while annotations of annotation types without <code>Documented</code> will not be displayed.</p> <dl> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>1.5</dd> </dl>    </main>  <div class="_attribution">
