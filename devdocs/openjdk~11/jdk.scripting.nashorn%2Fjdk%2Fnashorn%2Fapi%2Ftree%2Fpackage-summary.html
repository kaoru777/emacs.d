<p> Nashorn parser API provides interfaces to represent ECMAScript source code as abstract syntax trees (AST) and Parser to parse ECMAScript source scripts. </p> <p> Using parser API user can write Java code to access parse tree representation of ECMAScript source. Script source may be a file, a URL or a String. Unless stated otherwise null argument in methods of this package result in NullPointerException being thrown. </p> <pre data-language="java">import jdk.nashorn.api.tree.*;
