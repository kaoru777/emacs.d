public @interface Deprecated</pre> <div>
<p>A program element annotated <code>@Deprecated</code> is one that programmers are discouraged from using. An element may be deprecated for any of several reasons, for example, its usage is likely to lead to errors; it may be changed incompatibly or removed in a future version; it has been superseded by a newer, usually preferable alternative; or it is obsolete. </p>
<p>Compilers issue warnings when a deprecated program element is used or overridden in non-deprecated code. Use of the <code>@Deprecated</code> annotation on a local variable declaration or on a parameter declaration or a package declaration has no effect on the warnings issued by a compiler. </p>
<p>When a module is deprecated, the use of that module in <code>
 requires</code>, but not in <code>exports</code> or <code>opens</code> clauses causes a warning to be issued. A module being deprecated does <em>not</em> cause warnings to be issued for uses of types within the module. </p>
<p>This annotation type has a string-valued element <code>since</code>. The value of this element indicates the version in which the annotated program element was first deprecated. </p>
<p>This annotation type has a boolean-valued element <code>forRemoval</code>. A value of <code>true</code> indicates intent to remove the annotated program element in a future version. A value of <code>false</code> indicates that use of the annotated program element is discouraged, but at the time the program element was annotated, there was no specific intent to remove it.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>API Note:</dt> <dd>It is strongly recommended that the reason for deprecating a program element be explained in the documentation, using the <code>@deprecated</code> javadoc tag. The documentation should also suggest and link to a recommended replacement API, if applicable. A replacement API often has subtly different semantics, so such issues should be discussed as well. <p>It is recommended that a <code>since</code> value be provided with all newly annotated program elements. Note that <code>since</code> cannot be mandatory, as there are many existing annotations that lack this element value. </p>
<p>There is no defined order among annotation elements. As a matter of style, the <code>since</code> element should be placed first. </p>
<p>The <code>@Deprecated</code> annotation should always be present if the <code>@deprecated</code> javadoc tag is present, and vice-versa.</p>
