implements Attribute</pre> <div>
<p>Class <code>JobStateReason</code> is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that provides additional information about the job's current state, i.e., information that augments the value of the job's <a href="jobstate"><code>JobState</code></a> attribute. Class <code>JobStateReason</code> defines standard job state reason values. A Print Service implementation only needs to report those job state reasons which are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not have to report every defined job state reason. </p>
<p> Instances of <code>JobStateReason</code> do not appear in a Print Job's attribute set directly. Rather, a <a href="jobstatereasons"><code>JobStateReasons</code></a> attribute appears in the Print Job's attribute set. The <a href="jobstatereasons"><code>JobStateReasons</code></a> attribute contains zero, one, or more than one <code>JobStateReason</code> objects which pertain to the Print Job's status. The printer adds a JobStateReason object to the Print Job's <a href="jobstatereasons"><code>JobStateReasons</code></a> attribute when the corresponding condition becomes true of the Print Job, and the printer removes the <code>JobStateReason</code> object again when the corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Job's overall <a href="jobstate"><code>JobState</code></a> also changed. </p>
<p> <b>IPP Compatibility:</b> The category name returned by <code>getName()</code> is the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The <code>toString()</code> method returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.</p>
