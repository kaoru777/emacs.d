 <main role="main">   <h1>Package java.lang.ref</h1>   <section role="region"> <p id="package.description">Provides reference-object classes, which support a limited degree of interaction with the garbage collector. A program may use a reference object to maintain a reference to some other object in such a way that the latter object may still be reclaimed by the collector. A program may also arrange to be notified some time after the collector has determined that the reachability of a given object has changed. </p> <dl> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>1.2</dd> </dl> </section> <table>  <tr> <th scope="col">Interface</th> <th scope="col">Description</th> </tr>  <tr> <th scope="row"><a href="cleaner.cleanable">Cleaner.Cleanable</a></th> <td> <p><code>Cleanable</code> represents an object and a cleaning action registered in a <code>Cleaner</code>.</p> </td> </tr>  </table>
