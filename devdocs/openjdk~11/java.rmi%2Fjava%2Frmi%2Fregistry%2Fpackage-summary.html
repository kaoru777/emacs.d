 <main role="main">   <h1>Package java.rmi.registry</h1>   <section role="region"> <p id="package.description">Provides a class and two interfaces for the RMI registry. A registry is a remote object that maps names to remote objects. A server registers its remote objects with the registry so that they can be looked up. When an object wants to invoke a method on a remote object, it must first lookup the remote object using its name. The registry returns to the calling object a reference to the remote object, using which a remote method can be invoked. </p> <dl> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>1.1</dd> </dl> </section> <table>  <tr> <th scope="col">Interface</th> <th scope="col">Description</th> </tr>  <tr> <th scope="row"><a href="registry">Registry</a></th> <td> <p><code>Registry</code> is a remote interface to a simple remote object registry that provides methods for storing and retrieving remote object references bound with arbitrary string names.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row"><a href="registryhandler">RegistryHandler</a></th> <td>Deprecated. <div>no replacement</div> </td> </tr>  </table>
